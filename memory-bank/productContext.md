# Product Context

## Project Goals

The goal is to create a realistic and engaging World Cup 2026 Simulator web application. The user wants a tool to simulate the tournament from the group stage onwards, skipping the draw mechanism, and visualizing the results with a professional, "natural" football aesthetic.

## User Experience

- **Visuals**: A clean, light-mode dominant design with "natural" colors (white, green, blue) resembling a TV broadcast or official FIFA tournament app, avoiding "cyber" or "AI" aesthetics.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Start immediately at the Group Stage (teams pre-assigned or instantly fast-simulated).
  2. Simulate Group Matches.
  3. View Standings.
  4. 32-team Knockout Stage (Top 2 from each group + 8 best 3rd place teams).
  5. Simulate to Final.

## Key Features

- **Tournament Structure**: 12 Groups (48 teams), 32-team Round of 32.
- **Qualification Logic**: Top 2 teams from each group and the 8 best performing 3rd place teams advance to the Round of 32.
- **Simulation**: Ability to simulate specific matches, entire groups, or the whole tournament.
